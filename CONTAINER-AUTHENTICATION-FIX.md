# Container Authentication Fix - Critical Routing Issue Resolved

## Root Cause Identified
The `/api/auth/register` route exists but was being intercepted by a catch-all route (`app.get("*", ...)`) that was registered before the authentication routes. This caused all API requests to be served as static files instead of reaching the proper handlers.

## Fix Applied
1. **Moved catch-all route**: Relocated the SPA routing handler to the end of the route registration process
2. **Corrected route order**: Authentication routes now register before the catch-all handler
3. **Fixed static file paths**: Ensured proper path resolution for container environment

## Updated Files
- `server/docker.ts`: Removed premature catch-all route registration
- `server/container-auth-routes.ts`: Added catch-all route at the end of route setup
- `dist/docker.js`: Rebuilt with corrected routing order

## Deployment Steps
1. Stop current container: `docker-compose down`
2. Build new image with fixes:
   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile -t jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:fixed .
   ```
3. Update docker-compose.yml image tag to `:fixed`
4. Start containers: `docker-compose up -d`

## Expected Result
- Registration form will successfully submit to `/api/auth/register`
- User accounts can be created with username/password authentication
- Database tables will initialize automatically
- First registered user receives admin privileges

The authentication system is now properly configured for container deployment.
