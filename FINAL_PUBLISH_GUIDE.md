# Final Publishing Guide

## Use Replit's Version Control Interface

Since command line Git has lock issues, use Replit's built-in Git interface:

1. **Click Version Control tab** in left sidebar (Git icon)
2. **Review changes** - all your project files should be listed
3. **Add commit message**: "Season ticket management application complete"
4. **Click Commit & Push** - this bypasses command line restrictions

## Alternative: Manual GitHub Upload

If Version Control tab doesn't work:

1. **Download project**: Click ⋯ menu → "Download as zip"
2. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker
3. **Upload files**: "Add file" → "Upload files" → drag all project files
4. **Commit**: Add message and commit changes

## Deploy to Container Station

Once published:
```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker.git
```

This gives you complete React application instead of static page.
