# Publish Code and Update Container

## Step 1: Publish to GitHub

Since command line Git is restricted, use Replit's interface:

1. **Click Version Control tab** (Git icon) in Replit's left sidebar
2. **Add commit message**: "Complete ticket management application with React dashboard"
3. **Click "Commit & Push"** to publish to GitHub

## Step 2: Update Container Station

After publishing, run this on your NAS to get the complete application:

```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache
```

## What This Fixes

Currently your Container Station shows "Ready for use" but serves a static page. After this update:

- Complete React dashboard with navigation menu
- 49ers team data loaded and functional
- Financial analytics working
- All ticket management features active
- Database operations fully functional

The Docker Compose now pulls directly from GitHub, so you get the complete source code instead of the basic landing page.

## Quick Update Commands

For future updates:
```bash
# Stop container
docker-compose down

# Rebuild from latest GitHub code
docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```
