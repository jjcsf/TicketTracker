# Container Station Static Page Fix

## Issue
Your Container Station shows a basic landing page instead of the complete React application because it's missing the full source code.

## Solution

### Step 1: Publish Complete Code
Use Replit's Version Control tab (Git icon in left sidebar):
1. Add commit message: "Complete React application with dashboard"
2. Click "Commit & Push"

### Step 2: Replace Container Deployment
SSH to your NAS and run:

```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose down
rm -rf *
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker.git .
docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix
Access `http://your-nas-ip:5050` to see:
- Complete dashboard with navigation menu
- 49ers team data loaded
- Financial analytics working
- All ticket management features active

## Alternative: Manual Upload
If Git doesn't work:
1. Download project from Replit as zip
2. Upload to NAS file manager at `/share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker`
3. Replace all existing files
4. Run `docker-compose up -d --build`

Your application is fully functional in Replit - Container Station just needs the complete React source code to build the frontend properly.
