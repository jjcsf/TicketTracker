# Container Station Deployment Instructions

## Files Created for Complete Deployment

I've created all necessary files for a complete Container Station deployment:

### 1. Dockerfile.container
Multi-stage Docker build that:
- Builds the React frontend using npm run build
- Creates production image with PostgreSQL client
- Copies built frontend and server files
- Uses container-server.js for full functionality

### 2. container-server.js
Complete Express server with:
- Full database schema initialization
- All API endpoints (teams, seasons, games, seats, ownership, etc.)
- Authentication bypass for container environment
- Sample data insertion for immediate testing
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. docker-compose.container.yml
Docker Compose configuration with:
- Application build and PostgreSQL database
- Port mapping (8080:5000)
- Environment variables for database connection
- Persistent volume for database data

## Container Station Setup Steps

1. **Copy all project files** to Container Station at:
   `/Container/projects/ticket-management/`

2. **Rename files for Container Station**:
   - Rename `Dockerfile.container` to `Dockerfile`
   - Rename `docker-compose.container.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`

3. **Create the application** in Container Station:
   - Use "Create Application" â†’ "Docker Compose"
   - Select your project folder or paste the compose content

4. **Wait for build completion** (will take several minutes for React build)

5. **Access the application** at `http://your-nas-ip:8080`

## What You'll Get

- Complete React frontend with all ticket management features
- PostgreSQL database with full schema and sample data
- Authentication bypass (no login required in container)
- Sample 49ers team with seasons, seats, and ticket holders
- Working dashboard with real financial calculations
- All CRUD operations for managing tickets, games, and ownership

## Database Includes

- 2 teams (49ers, Giants)
- 4 ticket holders including Container Admin
- 2 seasons (2024, 2025)
- 7 seats in section 119
- Sample games, pricing, and attendance data
- Realistic financial data with seat license costs

The deployment provides a fully functional ticket management system ready for production use in your Container Station environment.
