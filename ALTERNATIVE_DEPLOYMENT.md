# Alternative Deployment Method - Direct File Transfer

Since Git operations are restricted in this Replit environment, here's how to deploy your complete application to Container Station:

## Method 1: Download and Upload

### Step 1: Download Project from Replit
1. In Replit, click the three dots menu (⋯) next to your project name
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. Save the zip file to your computer

### Step 2: Upload to NAS
1. Open your NAS file manager (usually at http://nas-ip:8080 or similar)
2. Navigate to `/share/Container/projects/`
3. Create folder named `SeasonTicketTracker`
4. Upload and extract all project files to this folder

### Step 3: Verify File Structure
Ensure these directories exist in `/share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker/`:
```
client/
server/
shared/
package.json
package-lock.json
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
vite.config.ts
tailwind.config.ts
tsconfig.json
```

### Step 4: Deploy in Container Station
1. Container Station → Applications → Create → Docker Compose
2. Browse to `/share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker`
3. Deploy application
4. Access at `http://your-nas-ip:5050`

## Method 2: SFTP/SCP Transfer

If you have SSH/SFTP access to your NAS:

1. Use WinSCP, FileZilla, or similar SFTP client
2. Connect to your NAS
3. Transfer entire Replit project to `/share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker/`

## Method 3: GitHub via Web Interface

1. Create repository at https://github.com/new
2. Name it `season-ticket-tracker`
3. Use GitHub's web interface to upload files:
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all project files
   - Commit changes

Then clone to your NAS:
```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/season-ticket-tracker.git SeasonTicketTracker
```

## Expected Result

Once all source files are properly deployed, you'll get:
- Complete React application interface
- Working dashboard with real data
- Full navigation menu
- Database with 49ers team data
- All ticket management features

The key is ensuring Container Station has access to the complete project source code, particularly the `client/src/` directory with all React components.
