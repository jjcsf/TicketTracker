# Manual GitHub Upload Instructions

## Issue
Replit's Git integration isn't pushing changes to GitHub automatically.

## Solution: Manual Upload
Since the Git repository is locked, you'll need to manually upload the key files to trigger the Docker build.

## Required Files to Upload to GitHub
Upload these files directly through GitHub's web interface:

### 1. Essential Container Files
- `container-interactive-server.js` - Fixed ES module server
- `Dockerfile.simple` - Container build configuration

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` - Automated Docker build

### 3. Docker Compose Configuration
- `docker-compose.published.yml` - Container Station deployment

## Manual Upload Steps
1. Go to https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop the files listed above
4. Commit message: "Add container deployment with ES module fix"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Automatic Trigger
Once uploaded, GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Build the Docker image
- Publish to `jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest`
- Make it available for Container Station

The workflow will complete in 5-10 minutes, then you can deploy using the Docker Compose configuration.
