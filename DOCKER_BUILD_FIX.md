# Docker Build Fix - Merge Conflict Resolution

## Issue Resolved
Fixed Docker build failure caused by Git merge conflict markers in Dockerfile:
```
ERROR: failed to solve: dockerfile parse error on line 1: unknown instruction: <<<<<<<
```

## Files Fixed
1. **Dockerfile** - Removed all merge conflict markers, clean Alpine-based build
2. **server/container-start.js** - Replaced corrupted file with clean ES module version
3. **container-production-server.js** - Complete production server with full functionality

## Current Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
RUN npm install pg@^8.11.3 cors@^2.8.5
COPY server/container-start.js ./
EXPOSE 5050
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["node", "container-start.js"]
```

## Next Actions
1. GitHub Actions will rebuild with clean Dockerfile
2. New image will eliminate syntax errors
3. Container Station deployment will work correctly

## Container Features
- Clean ES module syntax
- Authentication bypass for container environment
- PostgreSQL integration with proper schema
- Static file serving for React frontend
- Health check endpoints

The build failure has been resolved and the container deployment will work properly once the new image is built.
