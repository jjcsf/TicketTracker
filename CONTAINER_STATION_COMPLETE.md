# Complete Container Station Deployment

## Current Status
Your Container Station shows "Ready for use" but serves a basic landing page. This happens because the container needs the complete React source code to build the full application interface.

## Complete Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Get Complete Source Code
Since Git is restricted in Replit, use this method:

1. **Download Project**: Click the three dots (⋯) menu in Replit → "Download as zip"
2. **Extract on Computer**: Unzip the downloaded file
3. **Verify Contents**: Ensure you have these directories:
   ```
   client/src/components/
   client/src/pages/
   client/src/hooks/
   server/
   shared/
   package.json
   vite.config.ts
   ```

### Step 2: Upload to NAS
1. **Access NAS File Manager**: Open web interface (usually port 8080)
2. **Navigate to Container Path**: `/share/Container/projects/`
3. **Create Project Folder**: `SeasonTicketTracker`
4. **Upload All Files**: Transfer complete project structure

### Step 3: Update Container Station
1. **Stop Current Container**: In Container Station, stop the running application
2. **Remove Old Container**: Delete existing container to avoid conflicts
3. **Create New Application**: Use Docker Compose with the complete source
4. **Deploy**: Container Station will build the React frontend properly

### Step 4: Access Full Application
- URL: `http://your-nas-ip:5050`
- You'll see: Complete dashboard with navigation menu, not static page
- Features: Team management, season tracking, financial analytics

## Expected Result
Instead of the basic landing page, you'll get:
- Dashboard with 49ers data
- Navigation menu (Teams, Seasons, Games, Seats, etc.)
- Working database with real ticket data
- Financial analytics and reports
- All CRUD operations functional

The key is ensuring Container Station has access to the complete `client/` directory with all React components.
