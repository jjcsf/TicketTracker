# Manual GitHub Upload Solution

## Required Action
Since Git pushes are failing, upload these 3 files directly to GitHub:

### 1. container-interactive-server.js
Location: Root of repository
Purpose: ES module server with authentication bypass

### 2. docker-compose.published.yml  
Location: Root of repository
Purpose: Container Station deployment configuration

### 3. docker-publish.yml
Location: .github/workflows/docker-publish.yml
Purpose: GitHub Actions workflow for Docker builds

## Upload Process
1. Go to https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Drag the 3 files above (create .github/workflows folder if needed)
4. Commit message: "Add container deployment files"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Result
GitHub Actions will automatically build jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest for Container Station deployment.

The files are ready in this Replit workspace for upload.
