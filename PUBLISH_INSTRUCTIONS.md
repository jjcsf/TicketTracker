# Publishing Your Complete Project

Since Git command line has locks, use Replit's Git interface:

## Method 1: Replit Version Control
1. Click the "Version Control" tab in the left sidebar (Git icon)
2. You'll see all your changed files listed
3. Add a commit message: "Complete season ticket management application"
4. Click "Commit & Push"
5. Your code will be published to: https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker

## Method 2: Direct Shell Commands
Since you mentioned Git is working, try these in the Replit Shell:

```bash
# Remove lock file
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Complete ticket management system with React frontend and Express backend"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Deploy to Container Station
Once published to GitHub:

```bash
# On your NAS
cd /share/Container/projects/
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker.git
```

Then deploy in Container Station using the complete source code.

## What Gets Published
