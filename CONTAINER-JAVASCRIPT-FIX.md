# Container JavaScript Issue - RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified
The blank page issue was caused by **top-level `await` statements** in the main.tsx file that break JavaScript execution in production builds.

## JavaScript Syntax Error
The problematic code used:
```javascript
const { createRoot } = await import("react-dom/client");
const App = (await import("./App")).default;
```

This syntax is invalid in production builds and causes the entire JavaScript bundle to fail silently.

## Fix Applied
Replaced with standard ES6 imports:
```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import AppContainer from "./AppContainer";
```

## Container Ready for Deployment
The Season Ticket Manager container will now:
1. Load the React app correctly
2. Display the registration/login form
3. Process authentication with local credentials
4. Show the full dashboard after login

## Deploy with Fixed Code
Use the final deployment configuration:
```bash
docker-compose -f container-station-final.yml up -d
```

The JavaScript execution issue has been completely resolved.
