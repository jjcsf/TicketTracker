# Transfer Files to QNAP

## Method 1: Direct Copy (if you have SSH access)

Copy these files to your QNAP:
```bash
scp deploy-qnap-simple.sh qnap-simple-deploy.js admin@your-qnap-ip:/home/admin/
```

Then on your QNAP:
```bash
chmod +x deploy-qnap-simple.sh
sudo ./deploy-qnap-simple.sh
```

## Method 2: Manual Creation on QNAP

SSH into your QNAP and create the files directly:

### 1. Create the application file:
```bash
nano qnap-simple-deploy.js
```

Copy the entire content from the qnap-simple-deploy.js file shown above.

### 2. Create the deployment script:
```bash
nano deploy-qnap-simple.sh
```

Copy the entire content from the deploy-qnap-simple.sh file shown above.

### 3. Make executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x deploy-qnap-simple.sh
sudo ./deploy-qnap-simple.sh
```

## Method 3: One-Command Deployment

If you prefer, I can create a single command that downloads and runs everything:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/main/deploy.sh | sudo bash
```
