# Final Container Station Deployment Steps

## Current Status
- Container Station shows "Ready for use" 
- Currently serves static landing page
- Need complete React application deployed

## Step 1: Publish Complete Application

Use Replit's Version Control tab:
1. Click Git icon in left sidebar
2. Add message: "Complete season ticket management application"
3. Click "Commit & Push"

## Step 2: Update Container on NAS

SSH to your NAS and run:

```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache
```

## Expected Result

After container rebuilds:
- Access: `http://your-nas-ip:5050`
- Complete dashboard with navigation menu
- 49ers team data loaded
- Financial analytics functional
- All CRUD operations working

## Docker Compose Configuration

Your `docker-compose.yml` now builds from:
```yaml
build:
  context: https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker.git
```

This ensures latest code is always pulled from GitHub.

## Future Updates

1. Make changes in Replit
2. Push via Version Control tab
3. Run: `docker-compose up -d --build --no-cache`

Your application is fully functional in Replit - the container just needs the complete source code.
