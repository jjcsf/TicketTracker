# Git Setup Workaround for Replit

Since Replit has security restrictions on direct Git operations, here's how to properly connect your GitHub repository:

## Method 1: Replit Git Integration (Recommended)

1. **In Replit sidebar**, click the "Version Control" tab (Git icon)
2. Click "Connect to GitHub"
3. Authorize Replit to access your GitHub account
4. Select your `TicketManagement` repository
5. Replit will automatically sync your code

## Method 2: Manual Upload to GitHub

Since you've already created the repository:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketManagement
2. **Upload files**:
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag all project files from your computer (after downloading from Replit)
   - Commit changes

## Method 3: Force Remote Add (Advanced)

If you need command line access:

```bash
# Create a new terminal session
git remote add origin https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketManagement.git --force
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

## Deploy to Container Station

Once your code is on GitHub:

1. **SSH to your NAS**:
```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketManagement.git SeasonTicketTracker
```

2. **Deploy in Container Station**:
   - Applications → Create → Docker Compose
   - Browse to `/share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker`
   - Deploy application

The key is getting your complete source code to your NAS so Container Station can build the full React application instead of serving a static page.
