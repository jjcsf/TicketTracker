# Authentication Issue RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified
Static file middleware was intercepting API requests before they reached authentication routes.

## Fix Applied
Moved `express.static()` middleware to load AFTER authentication routes are registered in `server/docker.ts`:

```javascript
// BEFORE (broken):
app.use(express.static(...));  // Intercepted all requests
registerContainerAuthRoutes(app);

// AFTER (fixed):
registerContainerAuthRoutes(app);  // API routes first
app.use(express.static(...));      // Static files last
```

## Deployment
```bash
# Stop container
docker-compose down

# Build fixed image
docker build -f Dockerfile -t jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:fixed .

# Update docker-compose.yml image to :fixed

# Deploy
docker-compose up -d
```

## Expected Result
Registration requests will now reach `/api/auth/register` handler and complete successfully. Container logs should show:
```
[docker] POST /api/auth/register
[auth] POST /api/auth/register called with body: {...}
```

The authentication system is now properly configured for container deployment.
