# Complete Deployment Solution

## Current Situation
- Git operations are blocked by repository locks
- Container Station deployment is active but serves static page
- Need to get complete React application deployed

## Direct Solution

### Step 1: Download Complete Project
1. Click Replit menu (⋯) → "Download as zip"
2. Extract to your computer
3. Verify complete structure:
   - `client/src/components/` (all React components)
   - `client/src/pages/` (dashboard, teams, seasons, etc.)
   - `server/` (Express API)
   - `shared/` (database schemas)
   - `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub Manually
1. Go to https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker
2. Delete current repository contents (or create new repo)
3. Upload all extracted project files via web interface
4. Commit changes: "Complete ticket management application"

### Step 3: Deploy to Container Station
```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/
rm -rf SeasonTicketTracker  # Remove incomplete version
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker.git
cd SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Access Full Application
- URL: `http://your-nas-ip:5050`
- Login: Use email that matches ticket holder database
- Features: Complete dashboard, team management, financial analytics

## Result
Instead of static landing page, you'll get:
- Navigation menu with all sections
- 49ers team data loaded
- Working database operations
- Complete ticket management interface

# Complete Season Ticket Manager Deployment

## Option 1: Local Docker Build (Recommended)

### Build on Your Local Machine
```bash
# Clone or download the project
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker.git
cd TicketTracker

# Build and push to Docker Hub
docker build -f Dockerfile.simple -t jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest .
docker login
docker push jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest
```

### Container Station Deployment
Use this docker-compose.yml in Container Station:

```yaml
services:
  season-ticket-app:
    image: jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest
    ports:
      - "5050:5050"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:ticketpass123@postgres:5432/ticket_management
      - PGDATABASE=ticket_management
      - PGUSER=postgres
      - PGPASSWORD=ticketpass123
      - PGHOST=postgres
      - PGPORT=5432
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stopped

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=ticket_management
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ticketpass123
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Option 2: Pre-built Container (Alternative)

I'll create a complete application package you can deploy directly in Container Station without Docker Hub.

### Direct Container Station Deployment
1. Create project folder: `/share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker`
2. Copy all application files
3. Use docker-compose.local.yml for immediate deployment

## Option 3: GitHub Actions Fix

The workflow exists but may need manual triggering:
1. Go to: https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker/actions
2. Find "Build and Push Docker Image" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" manually
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for completion

Your Docker Hub credentials are set, so any push to main branch should trigger the build automatically.
