# Complete Deployment Solution

## Current Situation
- Git operations are blocked by repository locks
- Container Station deployment is active but serves static page
- Need to get complete React application deployed

## Direct Solution

### Step 1: Download Complete Project
1. Click Replit menu (⋯) → "Download as zip"
2. Extract to your computer
3. Verify complete structure:
   - `client/src/components/` (all React components)
   - `client/src/pages/` (dashboard, teams, seasons, etc.)
   - `server/` (Express API)
   - `shared/` (database schemas)
   - `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub Manually
1. Go to https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker
2. Delete current repository contents (or create new repo)
3. Upload all extracted project files via web interface
4. Commit changes: "Complete ticket management application"

### Step 3: Deploy to Container Station
```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/
rm -rf SeasonTicketTracker  # Remove incomplete version
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker.git
cd SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Access Full Application
- URL: `http://your-nas-ip:5050`
- Login: Use email that matches ticket holder database
- Features: Complete dashboard, team management, financial analytics

## Result
Instead of static landing page, you'll get:
- Navigation menu with all sections
- 49ers team data loaded
- Working database operations
- Complete ticket management interface
