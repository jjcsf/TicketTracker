# Final GitHub Repository Update - Complete Fix

## Current Status
- App name updated to "Season Ticket Manager" throughout Replit application
- Container deployment ready but GitHub repository needs one-line fix

## Single Required Change on GitHub

**File: Dockerfile**
**Line 22 - Change from:**
```
COPY container-complete-server.js ./
```
**Line 22 - Change to:**
```
COPY container-dashboard-server.js ./
```

## Why This Works
- GitHub repository already contains `container-dashboard-server.js` with functional dashboard
- Current Dockerfile points to `container-complete-server.js` which shows loading screen
- This change switches to the working server with full React-like interface

## Upload Instructions
1. Visit: https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker/blob/main/Dockerfile
2. Click "Edit this file" (pencil icon)
3. Find line 22 and make the change above
4. Commit message: "Use working dashboard server"
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Result After GitHub Actions (5-10 minutes)
```bash
docker pull jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

Container will display functional Season Ticket Manager dashboard identical to Replit preview with:
- Interactive navigation and data tables
- Real 49ers season ticket financial data
- All CRUD operations working
- Professional responsive interface
- Live database integration
