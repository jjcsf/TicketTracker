# Container Station Git Update Guide

## Current Status
Your application is fully functional in Replit. To update Container Station from Git:

## Step 1: First Publish Code to GitHub

Since Git locks prevent command line operations, use Replit's interface:
1. Click Version Control tab (Git icon) in left sidebar
2. Add commit message: "Complete ticket management application"
3. Click "Commit & Push" to publish to GitHub

Alternative: Download project as zip and upload to GitHub manually

## Step 2: Update Container Station from Git

Run this script on your NAS:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /share/Container/projects/

# Remove old deployment
rm -rf SeasonTicketTracker

# Clone latest from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker.git SeasonTicketTracker

# Deploy updated container
cd SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Step 3: Verify Update

Access `http://your-nas-ip:5050` to see:
- Complete React dashboard instead of static page
- Navigation menu with all sections
- 49ers team data loaded
- Working financial analytics

## Future Updates

After making changes in Replit:
1. Push to GitHub using Version Control tab
2. Run update script on NAS
3. Container automatically rebuilds with latest code

This gives you Git-based deployment workflow for Container Station.
