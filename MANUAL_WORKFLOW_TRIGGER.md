# Manual Workflow Trigger Instructions

Since the workflow file exists but Actions haven't started, here's how to trigger it:

## Method 1: Use Replit Version Control
1. Click the Git icon in Replit's left sidebar
2. Add commit message: "Trigger Docker build"
3. Click "Commit & Push"
4. This will trigger the workflow automatically

## Method 2: Manual GitHub Trigger
1. Go to: https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker/actions
2. Click "Build and Push Docker Image" (if visible)
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select "main" branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Method 3: Alternative Docker Hub Build
If GitHub Actions continues to have issues, we can build locally:

```bash
# Build and push directly
docker build -f Dockerfile.simple -t jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest .
docker push jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest
```

## Expected Result
Once triggered, the workflow will:
- Build the Docker image
- Push to Docker Hub as jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:latest
- Take 5-10 minutes to complete

After successful build, use the Docker Compose configuration I provided earlier in Container Station.
