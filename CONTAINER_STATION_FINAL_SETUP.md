# Final Container Station Setup - Complete Application

## Current Issue
Your Container Station shows "Ready for use" but serves only a basic landing page. The container needs complete React source code to build the full dashboard interface.

## Solution: Complete Source Transfer

### Download Complete Project
1. In Replit: Click three dots menu (⋯) → "Download as zip"
2. Extract the zip file on your computer
3. Verify you have ALL these directories:
   - `client/src/components/` (React components)
   - `client/src/pages/` (Application pages)
   - `server/` (Backend API)
   - `shared/` (Database schemas)

### Upload to Container Station
1. Access your NAS file manager (web interface)
2. Navigate to `/share/Container/projects/`
3. Replace existing `SeasonTicketTracker` folder with complete project
4. Ensure all React source files are present

### Redeploy Application
1. In Container Station: Stop current application
2. Delete existing container
3. Create new application using Docker Compose
4. Deploy with complete source code

## Result: Full Application Interface
After redeployment with complete source code:
- Dashboard with navigation menu
- 49ers team data loaded
- Financial analytics working
- All ticket management features active
- Database operations functional

The key difference: Container Station will build the React frontend instead of serving static HTML.
