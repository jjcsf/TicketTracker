# Resolving Git Push Conflicts

## The Issue
Your local branch is behind the remote repository. This happens when the GitHub repo has files that aren't in your Replit project.

## Solution Steps

### Method 1: Force Push (Recommended)
Since you want to publish your complete project, replace the remote content:

```bash
# In Replit Shell
git push --force origin main
```

This overwrites the remote repository with your complete application.

### Method 2: Create New Repository
If conflicts persist:

1. Create a new GitHub repository: `SeasonTicketTracker-Complete`
2. In Replit Shell:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker-Complete.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Method 3: Manual Upload
If Git continues to have issues:

1. Download your Replit project as zip
2. Go to GitHub.com
3. Create new repository: `SeasonTicketTracker-Final`
4. Upload all project files via web interface

## Deploy to Container Station
Once published, clone to your NAS:

```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/SeasonTicketTracker.git SeasonTicketTracker
```

Then redeploy in Container Station for the complete React application.
