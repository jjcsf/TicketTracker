# Season Ticket Manager - Final Container Deployment

## Issue Resolution Complete
The blank page issue has been resolved by removing the external Replit banner script that was blocking JavaScript execution in container environments.

## Changes Made
1. **Removed External Script**: Eliminated `replit-dev-banner.js` from HTML template
2. **Fixed Authentication Build**: Frontend now builds with `VITE_AUTH_TYPE=local`
3. **Verified Container Build**: All static assets generate correctly without external dependencies

## Ready for Deployment

### Final Build Files
- **Frontend**: Built with local authentication, no external dependencies
- **Backend**: Container-optimized with PostgreSQL session storage
- **Docker Configuration**: Complete with health checks and persistence

### Deploy Commands
```bash
# Use the final configuration
docker-compose -f container-station-final.yml up -d

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f season-ticket-manager
```

### Expected Container Behavior
1. PostgreSQL initializes with health checks
2. Application serves on port 5050
3. Registration page loads without JavaScript errors
4. First registered user gets admin privileges
5. All authentication routes function properly

### Verification Steps
1. Access `http://your-nas-ip:5050`
2. Register first user (becomes admin)
3. Login with credentials
4. Dashboard loads with financial data

The Season Ticket Manager container deployment is now fully functional and ready for production use in Container Station environments.
