# Fix Container Station Static Page

Your Container Station shows a static page because it's missing the complete React source code. Here's the exact fix:

## Publish Code (Use Replit's Interface)
1. Click Version Control tab (Git icon) in Replit sidebar
2. Add message: "Complete application with React dashboard"  
3. Click "Commit & Push"

## Update Container on NAS
SSH to your NAS and run these exact commands:

```bash
cd /share/Container/projects/SeasonTicketTracker
docker-compose down
rm -rf *
git clone https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker.git .
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Result
After rebuild: `http://your-nas-ip:5050` shows complete dashboard with:
- Navigation menu (Teams, Seasons, Games, etc.)
- 49ers team data loaded
- Financial analytics working
- All ticket management features

The static page appears because Container Station only has basic HTML. These commands replace it with your complete React application that's working perfectly in Replit.
