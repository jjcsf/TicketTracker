# Container Static Files Fix

## Issue Resolution
Fixed middleware order and async timing in Docker container to ensure both API routes and static files work correctly.

## Changes Made
1. **Restructured Docker server startup** - API routes register before static files
2. **Fixed async timing** - Proper sequential registration of middleware
3. **Maintained SPA routing** - Catch-all handler remains at end of route stack

## Deployment
```bash
# Stop container
docker-compose down

# Build with static file fix
docker build -f Dockerfile -t jjcsf/season-ticket-manager:working .

# Update docker-compose.yml to use :working tag

# Deploy
docker-compose up -d
```

## Expected Result
- Frontend loads correctly (no blank page)
- API authentication routes accessible
- Registration form submits successfully
- Static assets serve properly

The container now properly balances API routing with static file serving.
