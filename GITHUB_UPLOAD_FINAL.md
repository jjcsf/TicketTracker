# GitHub Repository - Corrected Files for Upload

## Issue Found
The GitHub repository has the correct container server files, but the Dockerfile is pointing to the wrong server file. The container is using `container-complete-server.js` which serves the fallback loading page instead of `container-dashboard-server.js` which has the working dashboard.

## Files to Upload (Replace existing):

### 1. Dockerfile (Updated)
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install ALL dependencies (including dev deps for build)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy all source files
COPY . .

# Build the frontend (creates dist folder)
RUN npm run build

# Install additional production dependencies for container server
RUN npm install pg@^8.11.3 cors@^2.8.5

# Verify dist folder was created and list contents
RUN ls -la dist/ || echo "dist folder not found"

# Copy the dashboard server to root
COPY container-dashboard-server.js ./

EXPOSE 5050
ENV NODE_ENV=production

CMD ["node", "container-dashboard-server.js"]
```

### Files Already Correct in Repository:
- container-dashboard-server.js (working dashboard with full functionality)
- docker-compose.published.yml (correct container configuration)

## Upload Instructions:
1. Go to https://github.com/jjcsf/TicketTracker
2. Click on "Dockerfile" 
3. Click "Edit" button
4. Replace content with updated Dockerfile above
5. Commit message: "Fix Dockerfile to use working dashboard server"
6. Click "Commit changes"

## Result:
GitHub Actions will rebuild the image using the working dashboard server. The container will serve the functional dashboard immediately instead of the loading screen.
